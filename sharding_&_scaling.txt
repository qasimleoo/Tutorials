**Sharding** and **scaling**, and how they relate:



### **1. Sharding**

* **Definition:** Sharding is **splitting a database into smaller, independent pieces called shards**, where each shard holds a subset of the data.
* **Purpose:** To **distribute data** across multiple machines to improve performance and manage large datasets.
* **How it works:** Each shard can be stored on a different server. Queries are routed to the correct shard.
* **Example:** A user database could be sharded by user ID:

  * Shard 1: Users 1–1,000,000
  * Shard 2: Users 1,000,001–2,000,000
* **Benefit:** Reduces load on a single database and improves **read/write performance**.
* **Trade-off:** More complex queries across shards and higher management overhead.

### **2. Scaling**

Scaling is about **increasing system capacity** to handle more traffic or data.

**Types of Scaling:**

1. **Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)**

   * Add more resources to a single server (CPU, RAM, storage).
   * Simple, but limited by hardware capacity.
   * Example: Upgrading a MySQL server from 16GB RAM → 64GB RAM.

2. **Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)**

   * Add more servers to **distribute load**.
   * Works well with sharding or distributed databases.
   * Example: Running multiple ClickHouse nodes, each storing part of the data.

**Quick analogy:**

* **Sharding** = Splitting a huge library into multiple smaller libraries, each holding a subset of books.
* **Scaling** = Making the library bigger (vertical) or adding more libraries (horizontal) to handle more visitors.

Not exactly, but they are **related concepts**:

* **Horizontal scaling** is the **general idea of adding more machines** to handle increased load.
* **Sharding** is **one way to achieve horizontal scaling** by splitting data across multiple machines.

Think of it like this:

* **Horizontal scaling** = “We need more servers to handle more users or data.”
* **Sharding** = “Let’s split the data between those servers so each one handles only part of it.”

You can also do horizontal scaling **without sharding**, for example:

* Replicating the same data on multiple read-only servers to **distribute read queries** (read scaling).

So: **all sharding is horizontal scaling**, but **not all horizontal scaling is sharding**.
