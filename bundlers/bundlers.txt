Bundlers:
What is a bundler?


we write our code in so many files in next/react .. like css, jsx, sass, jpg, png.. 
all these modules/files/dependencies.. are actually bundled/optimized 

Webpack is a module bundler for web applications. Its role is to take many separate frontend assets and dependencies and bundle, transform, and optimize them into files that browsers can efficiently load.

What Webpack actually does?

1. Module bundling

Webpack starts from one or more entry points and builds a dependency graph.

Example:
main.js
 ├─ utils.js
 ├─ api.js
 └─ styles.css


Webpack outputs something like:
bundle.js


Modern alternatives

| Tool        | Notes                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Vite**    | Faster, simpler, modern default |
| **Parcel**  | Zero-config bundling            |
| **Rollup**  | Excellent for libraries         |
| **esbuild** | Extremely fast, lower-level     |


Used in `React, Angular, VueJS`

Slower bundler as compared to the modern ones 


Another bundler is `Parcel` 
Quick setup (within minutes)



Esbuild
10-100 times faster than webpack

They also mention it on their website
esbuild.github.io

that how much fast is esbuild as compared to  all other (parcel, vite, webpack)

used under the hood in other tools that are (vite, bun)
(Limited as it doesn't run alone)



Vite (Rollup and Vite)
-- too fast
