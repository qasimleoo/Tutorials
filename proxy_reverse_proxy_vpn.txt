Proxy and Reverse Proxy

proxy is like asking your frind to mark your attendance on your behalf

private network --------->> public network
Mbl, laptop 	--------->> internet

Now you want to hide your private network from public so you need an interemediar 

private --->> proxy (forward proxy) ---->> network
now that response is also filtered by proxy server
private -->> proxy (filtered response) --> network

and also logs the traffic 
caches the requests like (movie trailer .. sends that in case of next request) .. saves bandwidth

Proxy is between Client and Internet (Squid is famous one)


Reverse proxy is between Internet and Server

internent --->> reverse proxy --->> server (backend)

reverse proxy example is (apache server, nginx)

Firewall vs Proxies
Can we use the same server as proxy and reverse proxy



Firewall
controls the traffic based on rules (IPs, Protocols, Ports) 
works at 3,4 layers from bottom to top or at network and transport layers 

Proxy
an intermidary that sends request on behlaf of clients
Proxies work at the application (http/https) layer that is the top one where the request actually comes from ..
- Hiding traffic
- Logging it
- Caching


Firewall = security gate
Proxy = middleman that communicates for you

--------------------
Can we use the same server as both a proxy and a reverse proxy?

Yes, you can.

A single server (e.g., running Nginx, HAProxy, Squid, or Traefik) can function as:

A forward proxy for internal clients


A reverse proxy for external users
----------
However, consider:
1. Security concerns
- Forward proxies often allow internal users to access external networks.
- Reverse proxies receive public-facing traffic.
- Mixing both can increase risk if not isolated properly.

--------------
2. Performance and resource usage
- Proxies can be CPU/memory intensive (TLS termination, caching, filtering).
- Running both roles on one machine may require tuning.

-----------
3. Separation of duties
Best practice:
Keep forward and reverse proxies separate, unless your environment is small or controlled.

----------
4. Configuration complexity
- One misconfiguration could expose internal networks.

-----------
When using one server for both is acceptable
- Small organizations or home labs
- Low traffic
- Clear separation of ports/services (e.g., reverse proxy on 80/443, forward proxy on 3128)
- Proper firewall rules to prevent unauthorized internal access

---------
When you should NOT combine them
- High-security environments
- High-traffic production systems
- Situations requiring network segregation


-------------------------------------

Not all proxies rotate/change IPs on each requests.. There are four main types of proxies ..

- Standard (Single IP) Proxy (Single static IP)
- Proxy having multiple IPs (Have multiple IPs but can send each request from the same IP)
- Residential (Mobile) Proxy (Rotate on every request)
- Transportational Proxies (Dont chnage IP at all)

A proxy changes your IP only if:
- It has multiple IPs and
- It is configured to rotate or choose among them.

Proxy vs VPN

Proxy
- Routes sepcific traffic only
- Changes IP for that traffic only
- No encyption at all
- used mainly for bypassing geo-blocks, caching, filtering


VPN
- Routes all traffic
- Changes your IP at network level
- Uses strong encryption
- Hides activity from networks, ISPs, attackers
- Used fro privact, security, remote access


Use a proxy if:
- You only want to route a specific app.
- You need speed and don’t need encryption.
- You want to test geo-locations or IP rotation.

Use a VPN if:
- You want full privacy.
- You’re on public Wi-Fi.
- You need to secure all traffic.
- You want to hide activity from your ISP.



------------------------
When connected to VPN ->

✔ Your ISP cannot see (But they do know you connected to which VPN and at what time):
- Websites you visit
- Content you send/receive
- Your online activity
- Your destination IPs
- What apps you use

✔ A VPN effectively hides:
- Your real IP (from websites/services)
- Your online activity (from ISP/network admins)

❌ Your ISP still sees:
- That you use a VPN
- When you use it
- How much data you use

❌ A VPN cannot hide:
- Activity inside logged-in accounts
- Activity from malware
- Anything you directly reveal
