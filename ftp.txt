FTP 
file transfer protocol

a communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network,

Uses TCP/IP

aslo used to upload/download files from webistes and servers

		  FTP
Client ------->>>> Server

it is not straightforward like scp .. we need to have ftp on client and vsftpd service on the server where we wanna sent the files 



Remote server Setup:
- need root access
- install vsftpd service (if not already)
You can check with 
~ rpm -qa | grep service_name (for kali)
~ dpkg -l | grep vsftpd (for ubuntu)

Check which system are you on:
~ lsb_release -a # on ubuntu
~ cat /etc/os-release # on any linux distribution


Close a stuck warp terminal tab
~ ps aux | grep ssh # look for stuck session
~ sudo kill -9 id



~  sudo apt install vsftpd

Config 
/etc/vsftpd.config # preserve|take backup  first

- anonymous_enable=NO
- Uncomment
  - ascii_upload_enable=YES
  - ascii_download_enable=YES
- May add
  - use_localtime=YES 

save and exit

Start and enable vsftpd ..
~ sudo systemctl start vsftpd
~ sudo systemctl enable vsftpd

Or reload if already running check using - status

Check if Firewall is there and running  otherwise Have to stop firewall as it doesn't allow vsftpd .. 
~ sudo systemctl stop firewalld.service



Client Server FTP setup:
- need root access
- install ftp service 
- sudo apt install ftp

~ ftp # a new shell will start with ftp


How to transfer file?

- ftp server_ip (ip of remote server) - will connect to server
- enter password/username
- put <file_name>


~ ftp 172.235.173.20
If you get error it is because firewall is blocking port 21 

So allow
On the FTP server, if you're using ufw:
~ sudo ufw allow 21/tcp
~ sudo ufw reload

If using firewalld:
~ sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=ftp --permanent
~ sudo firewall-cmd --reload

Try this:
ftp 172.233.62.133
Name: wf-blogs
Password: take from keep notes


ftp> put file_name

If it is givig permission erors you can login with sftp
exit 

~ sftp user_name@host|IP
ftp> put file_name

for multiple files we can use mput
ftp> mput file1 file2 file3

or use
ftp> put *
ftp> mput *


Downloading from remote to client

ftp> get filename
ftp> get *
ftp> mget file1 file2

For folders add -r flag

SCP vs FTP — Summary Table

| Feature       | SCP                  | FTP                             |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Encryption    | Yes (via SSH)        | No (unless FTPS/SFTP)           |
| Security      | High                 | Low (default)                   |
| Speed         | Usually fast         | Fast but unsafe                 |
| Setup         | Simple if SSH exists | Requires FTP server setup       |
| File browsing | Limited              | Full browsing + operations      |
| Common use    | Server file transfer | Website hosting, legacy systems |


Important notes

SCP ≠ SFTP
- SFTP is also SSH-based but works like FTP (browsing + full operations).
- FTP can be encrypted using FTPS, but it is more complex than SCP/SFTP.
